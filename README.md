# Dissertation study 1

The first study of my dissertation focuses on how perceptual learning generalizes across talkers.
Previous research has shown that perceptual adaptation to particular cue-category mappings can transfer from one talker to another (Kraljic & Samuel, 2006, 2007; Reinisch & Holt, 2014; Xie & Myers, 2017).
In addition, the benefits of exposure to an L2 accent can transfer to a new talker with the same accent (Alexander & Nygaard, 2019;
Sidaras et al., 2009; Tzeng et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018).
However, there is disagreement in the literature about the conditions under which adaptation generalizes across talkers (Baese-Berk et al., 2013; Bradlow et al., 2023; Bradlow & Bent, 2008; Xie et al., 2021; Xie & Myers, 2017).
Two different factors have been argued to facilitate generalization: (1) variability during exposure (Baese-Berk et al., 2013; Bradlow & Bent, 2008) and (2) similarity between the exposure and test talkers (Xie & Myers, 2017; Xie et al., 2021).
The present study features three experiments that directly compare variability and similarity during exposure to Spanish-accented English.
The overarching goal is to understand how listeners use acoustic-phonetic information to accommodate linguistic variation.

This repository contains a markdown with the full model outputs from all three experiments.
You can view the html output by clicking [this link](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/diss_study_1/adaptation_analyses.html).
Eventually, it will also contain the pre-print of the manuscript once it is accepted for publication, as well as the code used to generate the manuscript with R Markdown.
